Usage: "java -cp <classpath> se.kth.iv1350.startup.Main <options...>"
Single option:
	--help, -h
		Displays helpful information
	--inventory, -i
		Displays inventory
Multiple options:
	<goods> <payment>
		Default behaviour with goods from <goods> and payment from <payment>
	--path <path>, -p <path>
		Default behaviour with goods from <path>/goods.txt and payment from <path>/payment.txt
Examples:
	java -cp <classpath> se.kth.iv1350.startup.Main goods1.txt payment1.txt -p sale1 goods2.txt payment2.txt -p sale2
		Multiple options can be stacked and ordered in any way.
		This will simulate four different sales.
		The first sale will takes goods from goods1.txt and payment from payment1.txt.
		The second sale will takes goods from sale1/goods.txt and payment from sale1/payment.txt.
		The third and fourth sale follow the same logic.
